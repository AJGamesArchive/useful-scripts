# Info

This repo is a collection of scripts I've written over time that are either random stand alone scripts, or are scripts with useful functions that could be used in other projects to save time on writing functions for common tasks. This repo also contains a handful of programming challenges I was given to do at Uni.

This repo currently contains scripts for:

- TypeScript
- C#
- Python

# To Do(s)

- Fix Digit Word script so it detects number words with repeat letters correctly.
- Refine the C# Fizz Buzz script so there's no repeat logic.
- Finish testing the C# In A Row script.
- Refine the Python Black Jack game script.
- Add file reading to Python Hangman script so the guesser can't see the words that's been manually entered.
- Update a bunch of the old Python scripts so they use functions instead of While Loops.
