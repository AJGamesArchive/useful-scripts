- [Challenge Instructions](https://github.com/calaldees/TeachProgramming/blob/master/teachprogramming/static/projects/mini/max_profit.md)

## Optimization Test Results

The C# script was tested to see how efficient it was by timing how long it took to calculate the max profit from an array of 10,000 items.

- To calculate the profit from an array of 10,000 items when first compiled, the scripted took **~3.556** seconds.
- To calculate the profit from an array of 10,000 items when ran again, the scripted took **~0.244** seconds.
